Use Keychain Access.app to create the following self-signed code sign certificates:
* '3rd Party Mac Developer Application: The Growl Project, LLC' 
* '3rd Party Mac Developer Application'
* 'Mac Developer'

When doing a rebuild after a complaint about the certificate be sure to clean before running the build again. In extremis; restart xcode.
